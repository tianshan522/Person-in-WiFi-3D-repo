# Person-in-WiFi 3D: End-to-End Multi-Person 3D Pose Estimation with Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi signals, in contrast to cameras, offer privacy protection and occlusion resilience for some practical scenarios such as smart homes, elderly care, and virtual reality.
Recent years have seen remarkable progress in the estimation of single-person 2D pose, single-person 3D pose, and multi-person 2D pose. This paper takes a step forward by introducing Person-in-WiFi 3D, a pioneering Wi-Fi
system that accomplishes multi-person 3D pose estimation. Person-in-WiFi 3D has two main updates. Firstly, it has a greater number of Wi-Fi devices to enhance the capability for capturing spatial reflections from multiple individuals.
Secondly, it leverages the Transformer for end-to-end estimation. Compared to its predecessor, Person-in-WiFi 3D is storage-efficient and fast. We deployed a proof-of-concept system in 4m × 3.5m areas and collected a dataset of over
97K frames with seven volunteers. Person-in-WiFi 3D attains 3D joint localization errors of 91.7mm (1-person), 108.1mm (2-person), and 125.3mm (3-person), comparable to cameras and millimeter-wave radars.

## Prerequisites

- Linux
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- CUDA 10.1+
- [MMCV](https://mmcv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation)
- [MMDetection](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Please see [get_started.md](docs/get_started.md) for the basic usage of Opera.

### Remote Training on macOS

If your local machine is macOS and the actual training runs on a remote Linux GPU platform, use the DLP helper workflow under `remote_platform/dlp/`.

The workflow covers:

- mounting the remote NFS volume on macOS
- syncing the repository and dataset to the cloud volume
- submitting smoke tests and training jobs to DLP

See `remote_platform/dlp/README.md` for the full process.

### Project Status in This Repo Copy

This repo copy has already been adapted for a macOS local machine + remote Linux GPU workflow.

Current practical entry docs:

- remote training: `docs/远端训练说明.md`
- local inference and visualization: `docs/本地推理可视化说明.md`
- staged summary of recent progress: `docs/阶段性进展总结.md`
- DLP helper details: `remote_platform/dlp/README.md`

Current verified local inference checkpoint:

- `checkpoints/best_mpjpe_epoch_10_20260408.pth`
